In this project, I have built a simple image gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This gallery allows users to view and interact with images in an elegant, user-friendly, and responsive design. The project showcases how to display images in a grid layout and includes some interactive features to improve the user experience.


Features:
•	Image Grid Layout: The gallery displays images in a grid-based layout, making it easy to organize and view multiple images at once.
•	Responsive Design: The gallery adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring that the layout is optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
•	Hover Effects: A hover effect is applied to the images, where images slightly scale up making the interaction feel more dynamic.
•	Lightbox/Modal Feature: When an image is clicked, it opens in a lightbox-style modal (full-screen view), allowing users to view the image in greater detail. 

Technologies Used:
•	HTML: The structure of the page, including the layout for the image gallery and the modal component.
•	CSS: The styling of the gallery, including grid-based layout, hover effects, and responsiveness for different screen sizes.
•	JavaScript: The logic behind the image modal, including opening and closing the modal.
